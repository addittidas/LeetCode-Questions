// 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
/*  Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T
that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).” */
